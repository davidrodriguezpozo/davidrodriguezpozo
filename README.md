Hello everybody! 

🙋🏻‍♂️ I’m @davidrodriguezpozo, @_davidrdr in [twitter](https://twitter.com/_davidrdr) (though I'd like to be more active there). This repo contains all my personal projects. Right now it contains a lot of Data Science projects that I developed for my Master's degree (Msc in Data Science & AI) though from time to time I develop a side project and upload it here as well. 

🤖 I am the CTO of [Numerand](https://www.numerand.com/en), where we build the next-gen financial platform for SMBs and accounting firms. 

🚀 I got interested in software engineering at the end of my Aerospace Engineering degree, and I've been learning more things ever since.  

👨🏻‍💻 I would very much like to participate in open source projects when I find the time to do so, so any recommendations are welcome.

## Sort my thoughts

[Sort my thoughts](https://www.sortmythoughts.com) is a project I'm currently working on that helps the users take notes easily, with beautiful formatting tools and, on top of that, has a virtual AI assistant that helps the user organize and provide any information related to their notes.
