Hello everybody! 

🙋🏻‍♂️ I’m @davidrodriguezpozo, @_davidrdr in [twitter](https://twitter.com/_davidrdr) (though I'd like to be more active there). This repo contains all my personal projects. Right now it contains a lot of Data Science projects that I develop for my Master's degree (Msc in Data Science & AI) thought from time to time I develop a side project and upload it here as well. 

🤖 I am a software engineer working at [Cofi.ai](https://www.cofi.ai), where we build an amazing platform that offers data sanitizing, treatment, visualisation and (not yet) forecasting for any kind of metric. 

🚀 I got in the software engineering at the end of my Aerospace Engineering degree, and I've been learning more things ever since.  



👨🏻‍💻 I would very much like to participate in open source projects when I find the time to do so, so any recommendations are welcome. 


Reach me here or in twitter, any time you feel like so.
